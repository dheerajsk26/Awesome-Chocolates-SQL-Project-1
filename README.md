# SQL Portfolio Project-1

#### Welcome to my SQL project, which showcases my proficiency in using SQL for data analysis. Although I have used SQL in my work and completed projects during my master's program, this project marks my first SQL project for my portfolio. I have explored basic and advanced concepts of SQL and gained a solid foundation in writing complex queries to extract insights from a database. And I have used MySQL workbench for this project as Iâ€™m familiar with it. I am excited to share my work with you and hope you find it informative and engaging.

##### I haved used fictional database(Awesome chocolates) in this project provided by Chandoo.
